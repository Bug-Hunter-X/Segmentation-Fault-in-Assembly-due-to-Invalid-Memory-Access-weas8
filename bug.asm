mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the values in EBX, ECX*4, and 0x10. However, if the value of EBX + ECX*4 + 0x10 is outside the valid memory range accessible to the process, it will lead to a segmentation fault or other memory access violation.  This is a common error, especially when dealing with arrays or pointers, but it is often hard to debug because the error happens at runtime, not at compile time.
